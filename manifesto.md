# Cross Country can be popular - an attempt at bringing excitement to the world’s most boring sport with World Cross Relay

by Remington Breeze

World Cross Relay (henceforth referred to as WXR) aims to bring the sport of Cross Country running to a larger, global audience and in the process 1) better reward athletes who have dedicated their lives to running, 2) provide better entertainment for fans of running, and 3) offer an alternative pathway for runners who’s options have run out but want to continue to pursue cross country for the joy of running and team involvement. Cross Country is a team sport, something that is not appreciated enough in both Athletics / Track and Field, and in current Cross Country competition formats. Team competition is arguably the most entertaining portion of any sport for both competitors and spectators, and by failing to take advantage of this fact, Cross Country has been relegated to a sport reserved only for amateur student-athletes, small clubs with poor funding, and rare international competition with low viewership. While professional runners do exist, professional Cross Country runners do not, and the world’s best runners are compensated as a B or C league professional athlete would be in the world’s most popular sports. 

Cross Country, and running in general, is not inherently more boring than many sports that boast a much wider viewership. While tastes vary by individual, many sports are not interesting without key elements, and without knowledge of the sport. I draw no satisfaction from watching a baseball game or golf, but I don’t doubt that I would be entertained by either if I learned the intricacies of the games. By the same token, one of my favorite sports is Formula 1, something that most people I know (and most Americans for that matter) have no interest in. By contrast, I have no interest in NASCAR, a sport that has much higher viewership than F1 in the U.S. and is at face value similar to F1; again, this comes down to knowledge of the sport. F1 events are approximately 90 minutes long, much longer than a typical, current-format Cross Country event (10-12km in length or about 30-45 minutes), and (with exceptions) consist of relatively little action. The Tour de France has the world’s highest weekly attendance of any sport, and is an endurance race just as Cross Country is. The difference is prestige, sponsorship, and excitement; all of which can be added to Cross Country with effort. 

Popularity can come from lowering the barrier to entry of being entertained by the sport; everyone can appreciate a good rivalry, and everyone can be loyal to a local team or a team they have an emotional connection to. The most widely entertaining, and thus the most popular, sports share several elements that are missing from current Cross Country competition formats. WXR aims to address these shortcomings.

For a sport to be popular, it needs funding. For a sport to get funding, it needs to be popular. Popularity is difficult to force; however, funding can be brought in from anywhere, so this conundrum can be broken by incentivizing high levels of competition with a large prize pool, which can come from any number of sources. Popularity does not happen overnight, so for WXR to be successful, a slow spread of interest is inevitable. However, funding can happen overnight, which can in turn accelerate the dissemination of interest in the sport. I envision a model where large companies sponsor teams, with the largest sponsors getting partial naming rights to the team itself. Almost every commercialized sport makes use of many sponsors on jerseys, uniforms, and equipment, and WXR will as well. 

As stated above, team competition is makes a sport more enthralling; an extension of this is team loyalty. Location is a quick way to a fan’s heart; if you are from a certain area, you will immediately have a connection to a team that is from the same area. Whether or not you have an interest in the sport itself, if you catch brief coverage of the sport (for example at a restaurant, a friend’s house, etc.), you will find yourself rooting for the team that has the most familiarity. Often this is a location, but it can also be a preferred brand (e.g. rooting for Nike over Adidas). Team identity leads to team loyalty, which leads to superfans and higher viewership. 

Additionally, the current Cross Country competition format involves many more athletes in play at a time than any other popular sport. It is not uncommon for a Cross Country race to have over 200 athletes; most sports have 10-30 athletes competing at a time. This makes it difficult to televise, and difficult for spectators to follow. Cross Country races may also have dozens of teams represented at a time, again making it difficult to follow. By limiting the number of competitors and teams, WXR attempts to address these issues. Lower numbers of athletes competing at any given time also encourages the development of fanbases for individual competitors. 

Another large aspect of any popular sport is strategy. Current Cross Country strategy can typically be summed up in one of a few short phrases: “Give it everything you have”, “Sit and kick”, or “Run as a pack”. None of these offer intrigue or excitement for the audience. Dark horses can come from nowhere and take unexpected victories and podiums, but these events are often buried in large fields of hundreds of athletes, as discussed above. By introducing variable length relay legs, strategy becomes an integral component of competition in WXR. Points awarded for fastest sectors offer another strategic variable that will keep the audience engaged.
